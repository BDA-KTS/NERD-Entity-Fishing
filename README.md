# Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) Fishing  

## Learning Objectives
This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Entity-Fishing tool. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of NER and its applications.
- Use the Entity-Fishing tool to extract entities from text.
- Analyze and interpret the results in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Social Science Use Cases
NER is widely used in social sciences for:
- Analyzing historical texts to identify key figures, locations, and events.
- Extracting insights from large datasets like news articles or social media posts.
- Supporting qualitative research by automating entity extraction.

## Duration
2-3 hours

## Target Audience
This tutorial is designed for:
- Social science researchers interested in text analysis.
- Data scientists and analysts exploring NER applications.
- Beginners with basic Python knowledge and familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Setting Up The Computational Environment
Please specify which Python version to use and also update the `requirements.txt`:
- Python version >= 3.10 installed.
- Jupyter Notebook environment set up.
- Basic understanding of Python programming.

Please follow the notebook to understand the technical details of the tutorial.

It outputs:
- A detailed report of extracted entities.
- Insights and patterns derived from the analysis.

## Takeaways, Conclusion for the Reader to Learn from the Tutorial
- Learn how to use Entity-Fishing for NER tasks.
