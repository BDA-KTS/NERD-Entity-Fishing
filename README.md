# README (Update). 
I have provided a basic template on how a README for MethodsHub should look like. Please update it for better user-experience.

## Learning Objectives
This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Entity-Fishing tool. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of NER and its applications.
- Use the Entity-Fishing tool to extract entities from text.
- Analyze and interpret the results in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Social Science Use Cases
NER is widely used in social sciences for:
- Analyzing historical texts to identify key figures, locations, and events.
- Extracting insights from large datasets like news articles or social media posts.
- Supporting qualitative research by automating entity extraction.

## What Length - Duration
