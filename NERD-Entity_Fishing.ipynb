    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the vast landscape of natural language processing (NLP), Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Disambiguation play pivotal roles towards understanding and extracting valuable information from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entities are specific, named elements in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. Named Entity Recognition is the process of automatically identifying and classifying these named entities within a given text. It forms the foundation for a wide range of applications, from information retrieval and question answering to sentiment analysis and knowledge graph construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the journey doesn't stop at just recognizing named entities. In real-world scenarios, the same name can often refer to multiple entities depending on the context. This brings us to the challenge of Named Entity Disambiguation, which is the process of determining the correct entity a name refers to, particularly in cases of ambiguity. For instance, does \"Michael Jordan\" refer to the Actor or the Sportsperson? This is where disambiguation comes into play, making NER not only about identification but also about understanding context."

    "## FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use off-the-shelf tools for entity linking and disambiguation?** Off-the-shelf tools offer *pre-built solutions* that save time and resources. They are often trained on *large datasets*, providing a good starting point for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What types of entities can be linked using these tools?** Most tools support common entities like *persons, organizations, and locations*. Some may also handle *specific domains* or custom entities based on the tool's training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How accurate are off-the-shelf tools?** Accuracy varies among tools. It depends on factors such as the *quality of training data*, the *diversity of entities*, and the *specific use case*. Evaluation metrics like *precision, recall, and F1 score* help assess accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do these tools work for multiple languages?** Many off-the-shelf tools support *multiple languages*, but the level of accuracy can vary. It's essential to check the *documentation* for language support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can these tools be fine-tuned for domain-specific applications?** Some tools offer the possibility of *fine-tuning* on domain-specific data. However, it depends on the tool's *architecture and capabilities*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do these tools handle ambiguous references?** Ambiguity resolution depends on **context** and available information. Some tools use *machine learning models* that consider surrounding words, phrases, or contextual information to disambiguate references.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are there privacy concerns when using entity linking tools?** Yes, privacy concerns may arise, especially if the text contains *sensitive information*. It's crucial to review the tool's *privacy policy* and consider using it with proper *data anonymization practices*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What knowledge bases do these tools typically use?** Tools may use popular knowledge bases like *Wikidata, DBpedia, or Freebase*. Some tools allow users to specify *custom knowledge bases* or integrate with proprietary databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can these tools handle real-time processing?** Real-time processing capabilities vary. Some tools are optimized for *speed*, while others may be more suitable for *batch processing*. Consider the specific requirements of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do these tools handle typos or misspellings?** Some tools include mechanisms to handle *typos or misspellings* through *fuzzy matching* or *probabilistic models*. However, their effectiveness may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are there limitations to off-the-shelf tools?** Yes, limitations can include handling *rare entities*, dealing with *noisy or informal text*, and adapting to *highly specialized domains*. It's essential to understand the tool's *strengths and weaknesses*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do these tools require internet access?** Some tools may require *internet access* to query external knowledge bases. Check the tool's *documentation* for offline or custom knowledge base options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How scalable are these tools for large datasets?** Scalability depends on the tool's *architecture*. Some tools are designed for *large-scale processing*, while others may be more suitable for *smaller datasets*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can I combine multiple tools for better performance?** Yes, combining multiple tools (*ensemble methods*) can improve performance and mitigate the limitations of individual tools. However, *integration complexity* should be considered.\n"
